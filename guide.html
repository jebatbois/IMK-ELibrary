      <h2>How To Borrow Book</h2>
      <p>Borrowing a book on our digital library platform is designed to be quick and simple. There are two main ways you can borrow a book: by browsing directly through the Book Catalogue or by using the Search feature to find a specific title.</p>
      <p>If you prefer to explore manually, you can scroll through the Book Catalogue and click on any book cover or title to view more details. On the book’s detail page, you’ll find a "Borrow Book" button. Simply click this button to borrow the book instantly—provided that copies are currently available. If the book is already borrowed by other users and no copies remain, the button will be disabled or replaced with a message indicating that the book is unavailable for borrowing at the moment.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you’re looking for a specific book or author, you can use the search bar at the top of the page. Once the search results are displayed, click on the book you’re interested in. You’ll be taken to the same detail page, where you can proceed to borrow the book just as described above.</p>
      <p>After successfully borrowing a book, it will appear in your "My Books" section, where you can begin reading immediately or manage your current loans. Each borrowed book will include information about the due date and an option to return early if desired.</p>

      <h2>How To Save Book</h2>
      <p>If you find an interesting book on the Book Catalogue page but don’t want to borrow it right away, you can use the “Save for Later” feature. This allows you to keep books in your personal list so you can easily find them again later.</p>
      <p>To save a book, simply click the "Save for Later" button available on each book card or detail page. The book will automatically be added to your Saved Books list, which you can access from your profile or the navigation menu.</p>
      <p>This feature is perfect for creating a personal reading list without borrowing immediately. You can return to it anytime and borrow the saved books with just one click.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>How to View Your Saved Books</h2>
      <p>After saving books using the "Save for Later" feature, you can easily view them by clicking the "Saved" button located on the website’s navbar (top navigation bar).</p>
      <p>Once clicked, you’ll be taken to a dedicated page that displays all the books you’ve saved. Each book will appear with details like the title, author, and cover image, along with buttons to borrow the book or remove it from your saved list.</p>
      <p>This feature helps you keep track of books you’re interested in, without the need to search again. So whenever you’re ready to read, just head to your Saved Books page, choose a title, and start reading or borrowing with ease.</p>

We may share or use your information when you register for an account or interact with the platform, but we only collect certain personal details, such as your full name, email address, and student identification number if you are a Universitas Maritim Raja Ali Haji (UMRAH).

      <h2>Return Policy</h2>
      <p>At our digital library platform, we aim to provide a smooth and user-friendly borrowing experience. All borrowed e-books are subject to a set borrowing period, which will be clearly indicated at the time of checkout. Once this period ends, the system will automatically revoke access to the e-book—there is no need for users to manually return the book.</p>
      <p>However, if users wish to return a book before the due date, they can do so by visiting the "My Books" section. Each borrowed book will have a "Return" button. Clicking this will instantly remove the book from your borrowed list and make it available again for others to borrow.</p>
      <p>We do not impose any late return fees, as the system handles expiration automatically. However, repeated misuse of the system—such as attempting to bypass return deadlines, hoarding books without reading, or...</p>
